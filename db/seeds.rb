# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# require 'faker'
# goals = Goal.all
# goals.each do |g|
#   1..5.times do
#     g.comments.create(text: Faker::Lorem.paragraphs(rand(1..2)))
#   end
